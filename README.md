# Trancendances's AnchorCMS theme

This theme has been designed and coded by [Thibaut Cornu](https://twitter.com/thibautcornu) and [Damien Erambert](https://twitter.com/Eramdam), and distributed under the MIT/X11 license (see `MIT-LICENSE.txt`).

To install it on your own AnchorCMS instance, just clone this repo in your `themes/` directory.

**Please note that this theme has been optimised for AnchorCMS 0.9.3. We are aware that later versions were released (0.12.3 when writing these lines), but they have been tested by our team and considered too buggy to be used in production.**
